# Smart-Traffic-Lighting-System
A smart traffic light is one which "senses" the traffic and then only starts operating. If no vehicle is detected nearby, the color of the light remains green. If vehicles are detected then the traffic light works in a normal way. This project is made using an arduino and an IR sensor.
